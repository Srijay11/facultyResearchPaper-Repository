# facultyResearchPaper-Repository

<h3>ABSTRACT</h3>
Over the past few decades, the number of publications being published by university faculty all over the world has exponentially increased, mainly due to the digitization of publishing. This makes finding relevant ones a very difficult task, leading to problems such as research gaps or redundancies, where multiple publications are published on the same topic, due to the authors of one not knowing about the existence of the other. To solve such problems, we need a common repository that stores this massive number of publications and also provides additional functionalities such as grouping by topics, or tracking all the publications of a single author. This is what our project aims to do, a single repository for all faculty publications, where inconsistency and unavailability of information will become a thing of the past.
